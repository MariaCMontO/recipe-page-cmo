## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to center a div using flexbox on the body element in CSS. I also learned how to reset default HTML styles on elements like paragraphs, among other things.
In this project, I worked with the rem unit, so I used a configuration on the html element to make 1rem=10px.
I learned how to use a box-shadow.

```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
main {
    background-color: var(--white);
    width: 38.4rem;
    height: 52.2rem;
    border: 0.2rem solid #111111;
    border-radius: 2rem;
    padding: 2.4rem;
    box-shadow: 0.8rem 0.8rem 0rem 0rem #111111;
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely want to keep developing interfaces using the rem unit - it makes many task much easier. However, I also want to improve my understanding about paddings and margins to become a more practical and efficient developer.
